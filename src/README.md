# Sharedy

This client-side JavaScript app lets you quickly share image files directly
from your [remoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io).

## Development setup

We're using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), so for starting a local webserver,
opening the app in a browser, auto-compiling everything and reloading on
changes, just run `yeoman server` and that's it.

## Bugs, issues, feature suggestions

If you find a bug or problem, or have a useful suggestion, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/skddc/sharedy/issues), and I will try to attend to it
as soon as possible. [Pull requests](https://github.com/skddc/sharedy/pulls)
with actual fixes would be even better, of course.
